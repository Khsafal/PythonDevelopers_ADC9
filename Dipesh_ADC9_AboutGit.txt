git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. 
Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master
